<h1>SIMPLE CBR PROJECT</h1>

<h3><strong>Cased Based Reasoning</strong></h3>


<p>I try to represent all the fases of CBR but is just a simple example.</p><br>
<p>A real CBR has many other validation o principal in the review part and retain part.</p><br>
<p>My implementation is based on a book that I read  and is simple only to practice purpose!</p>
